# CIS1415Final
Final project for CIS 1415 Intro to Programming, Spring Semester
This program allows a user to customize a weekly meal plan, with dishes being pulled from a bank 
of dish names in an external text file. Under each week day is a button displaying a dish name.
Clicking the button will display a drop down menu, with the options "Randomize," "Customize," 
and "Blank." "Randomize" will change the button label to a random dish name. "Customize" will open
a dialog window in which the user can choose a specific dish from the bank of dish names. "Blank"
will set the label to blank. At the bottom of the window are three buttons, "Randomize Week," 
"Finalize Week," and "Add New Dish." "Randomize Week" will set all of the buttons above to a
random dish name. "Finalize Week" will return a plaintext version of the weekly mealplan. "Add New
Dish" opens a prompt window and adds the provided dish name to the bank of dish names.
